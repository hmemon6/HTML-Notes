            <h2>Cycling in Tuscany</h2>
            <p>
                Bike on quiet roads over rolling hills through the heart of Tuscany. Perhaps stopping for a long lunch at a local vineyard, medieval town or just a roadside field where you can kick back and enjoy an afternoon snooze.
                Gorgeous golden hillsides, rich artistic heritage, gentle biking paths and great food and wine at the end of a dayâ€™s cycling make this tour a perfect mix of what makes Tuscany great.
