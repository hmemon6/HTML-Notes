    This weeks featured game is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dark-souls-iii/">Dark Souls III</a> a game of valleys and peaks, down through dungeons and up over castle walls. It's a plummet into places we shouldn't be, an escape from places we don't belong. But of course, we fight our way through the darkness, and find our way out. There are a few stumbles along the way, but in the end, Dark Souls III is well worth the riveting climb. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-xv/">Final Fantasy 15</a> will launch on September 30, 2016 publisher Square Enix has announced. The date was revealed during the Uncovered: Final Fantasy XV event, which is being held in Los Angeles.
