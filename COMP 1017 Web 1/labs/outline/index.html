                <p>
                    At Shantilly Yoga, we keep our prices down to enable you to experience a unique practice environment in the downtown core. We offer use of mats and props for free. As one of the longest-running yoga studios in Edmonton,
                    we are passionate about what we do. All of our teachers have a depth of experience that they bring to each class and workshop. We don't have a one-size-fits-all approach, you will be seen, heard and valued in our warm
                    and welcoming environment. We are a relaxing sanctuary amidst the hustle and bustle of downtown Edmonton, and your busy lives.

                <h2>Yoga atmosphere</h2>
                <p>The homey atmosphere creates a soothing environment which sets you at ease at once. We are a smaller one room studio, which means smaller class sizes and more hands on instruction, with personal interaction.</p>

                <h2>Shantilly Yoga etiquettes</h2>
                <p>The yoga room is silent before, during and after class. During the class, the instructor is the only one speaking. There are some general etiquette guidelines to follow in the studio:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>With respect to those sensitive to fragrances we ask that you refrain from wearing strong scents. We also refrain from burning incense.</li>
                    <li>We ask you to be mindful of others at the studio if you plan on attending class please be on time to respect the sacred place of others.</li>
                    <li>The instruction is verbal and very technical with no demonstrations. It is very important that you are actively listening to the instructor throughout class and allow others the same courtesy.</li>
                    <li>
                        There are no shoes in the studio. Please be aware that you’ll be barefoot in the yoga room—any contagious foot conditions should be treated as soon as possible or covered/dressed while walking through the studio.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Please bring only your mat, towel and water into the room. Do not bring purses, wallets, phones or other distractions. Due to the heat and humidity in the room, these types of items could be damaged and may pose as a
                        distraction.
                    </li>

                <h2>Spring Workshop</h2>
                <p>
                    It happens every spring. This year’s Spring Yin Workshop will be with Tori Lunden on Saturday, May 28, 2016 from 2:15pm - 4:15pm. After the joy and jubilation of being able to play outside comes the aches and pains in
                    areas we forgot we had. It comes as a bit of a shock to our bodies this shift to suddenly gardening, biking, running, hiking, along with all the other outdoor activities we love. Even for those that stay active through
                    the winter; the spring is often accompanied by stiff muscles and creaky joints
                </p>
                <p>
                    This extended practice will help our bodies through this rocky transition with a combination of gentle movement and passive, supported stretches for the shoulders, back, and hips. Take two hours to relax and restore so
                    you can get on with enjoying our beautiful Edmonton summer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This practice is suitable for beginners, experienced students, and especially beneficial for those with active lifestyles. The cost will be $30 (includes GST). Please register in advance at
                    <a href="#">http://www.shantillyyogastudio.ca/events</a> or call 780-421-9444
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tori's classes are always a fun and eclectic environment. She delights in teaching people who, like her, never thought yoga was something they could do let alone enjoy. Tori has a degree in social work from the
                    University of Calgary and has been teaching yoga since 2008; when she would never again work anywhere that required her to sit for eight hours a day.

                    <h3>The Flow Yoga Class</h3>
                    <p>
                        The flow classes continuously move your body integrating strength and flexibility in a non-stop shift from posture to posture. The flow classes vary from slower basic movements to progressively more advanced. We
                        support slower movements and believe in the healing aspects associated with the ability to slow down and stay present. Our teachers encourage a mindful state to practice from, which supports healing physically,
                        emotionally and spiritually.
